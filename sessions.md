**Session Breakdown (7 Sessions, 2 hours each)**

---

## Session 1 - Planning & Research (2 hours)

### 1. Knowledge Assessment (30 mins)

- **Identify key concepts** you need to learn or review for this project:
  - Resumes, Cover Letters & ATS basics
  - Generative AI for text (prompt engineering, limitations)
  - Job-specific keyword optimization
  - AI-driven job matching & HR agent simulations
  - Node.js/Express basics (if applicable)
  - Frontend framework (React, Vue, or your choice)
- **Use your AI assistant** to get clear explanations of any unfamiliar concepts and gather best learning resources.

### 2. Project Understanding (30 mins)

- **Break down requirements** based on the **Milestones** (Core Generation, ATS Optimization, AI-Driven Job Matching).
- **Create a Trello board or GitHub project** to track these milestones:
  1. Core Resume & Cover Letter Generation (Tier 1)
  2. ATS & Keyword Enhancements (Tier 2)
  3. AI-Powered Job Matching & HR Agent Evaluation (Tier 3)
- **Identify challenges** (e.g., ensuring AI doesn’t produce “fluff,” dealing with incomplete user data).
- **Check out similar AI resume tools** to see standard features and unique selling points.
- **Ask your AI assistant** for architectural suggestions (backend vs. frontend, data flow, API endpoints).

### 3. Environment Setup Planning (15 mins)

- **List required tools** and confirm versions:
  - Node.js, npm (or Yarn), any specific frameworks/libraries
  - Code editor setup (VSCode, WebStorm, etc.)
  - Git repository and branching strategy
- **Document any API keys or accounts** needed for:
  - OpenAI/Claude/Bard or whichever LLM provider
  - Any additional services for job data or analytics

### 4. Technical Design (30 mins)

- **Draft a basic component/module structure**:
  - Frontend form or CLI to collect user data
  - Resume & cover letter generator service (backend or API layer)
  - ATS keyword extraction module
  - Optional advanced matching/HR agent module
- **Plan initial data structures** (user profile, job description, resume model).
- **Use your AI assistant** to review and refine these initial designs.

### 5. Learning Strategy (15 mins)

- **Create a list of questions** for your AI assistant:
  - “How can I prompt for professional, well-structured resumes?”
  - “What’s the best way to handle missing user info in generation?”
  - “How do I evaluate ATS alignment systematically?”
- **Document example prompts** you might use frequently (e.g., “Rewrite this resume bullet to sound more achievement-focused”).

### Session 1 Takeaways

- Clear sense of **project scope** and relevant AI/resume/ATS concepts
- **Trello/GitHub board** with tasks for upcoming sessions
- **Environment setup plan** and required credentials
- **Architecture outline** for how data flows through the generator
- **Confidence** in using your AI assistant for conceptual clarity

## Session 2 - Core Resume & Cover Letter Generation (2 hours)

### Development (1 hour 30 mins)

- **Set up your frontend/back-end skeleton** (e.g., Express server, React app).
- **Implement a minimal form or CLI** to collect user data (name, experiences, skills).
- **Create a prompt** for your AI assistant that generates a **basic resume** from user data.
- **Build a basic cover letter generator** (can be a simple prompt that reuses resume data).
- **Focus on prompt refinement**: Work with your AI assistant to ensure the tone and structure are professional.

### Learning Reflection (30 mins)

- **Review** what you built:
  - Does the resume/cover letter meet **Tier 1** criteria (basic generation from user input)?
- **Document** any confusing aspects of prompt engineering (tone adjustments, best prompt structure, etc.).
- **List** new questions or issues that arose (e.g., “How to handle empty skill fields gracefully?”).
- **Ask** your AI assistant for specific improvements to resume & cover letter outputs.

## Session 3 - ATS Optimization & Keyword Enhancements (2 hours)

### Development (1 hour 30 mins)

- **Add a feature** to parse a job description (file upload or text area).
- **Extract critical keywords** using simple NLP or your AI assistant.
- **Compare** those keywords against the user’s existing resume content.
- **Implement suggestions** to improve ATS score:
  - Insert missing keywords in a natural way (avoid repetition).
  - Provide an **ATS alignment score** or percentage match.
- **Use your AI assistant** to refine the approach (e.g., best way to measure alignment, how to maintain readability).

### Learning Reflection (30 mins)

- **Review** the ATS-related code:
  - Are keyword extractions accurate or do they need more advanced NLP?
  - Does the resume remain cohesive after inserting new keywords?
- **Document** insights on ATS best practices (from your AI or external research).
- **List** questions about maintaining a professional voice while adding keywords.
- **Plan** next steps for more advanced feature sets (job matching, HR agent, etc.).

## Session 4 - AI-Powered Job Matching & HR Agent Simulation (2 hours)

### Development (1 hour 30 mins)

- **Set up** advanced matching logic:
  - Could be a simple array of job postings or integrated with an external job board API.
  - Use embeddings or semantic similarity (if feasible) to rank job relevance.
- **Implement HR agent simulation**:
  - AI critiques resume, highlights strengths/weaknesses, suggests rewrites.
  - Possibly store “feedback” to show the user how the resume improved.
- **Collaborate** with your AI assistant to ensure the prompts produce constructive, actionable feedback.

### Learning Reflection (30 mins)

- **Review** the matching functionality:
  - Does it provide a clear “why” for top jobs?
- **Document** how the HR agent was prompted:
  - Are the critiques helpful, or do they repeat general advice?
- **List** any leftover concerns about how to weigh user data vs. job requirements.
- **Ask** your AI assistant for best practices on feedback loops or iterative resume rewrites.

## Session 5 - Frontend & User Experience Enhancements (2 hours)

### Development (1 hour 30 mins)

- **Improve the UI** (if building a web interface) or overall user flow (if CLI).
- **Add** visual indicators for ATS score, job matches, or HR feedback.
- **Implement** form validations (e.g., required fields, skill checks).
- **Focus** on making the generator easy to use and understand.
- **Seek** your AI assistant’s input on UI/UX improvements or best patterns for clarity.

### Learning Reflection (30 mins)

- **Review** UI changes and overall user experience:
  - Is the process intuitive from data input → result?
- **Document** any feedback from test users or your own QA.
- **List** questions regarding accessibility or design best practices.
- **Ask** your AI assistant for suggestions on how to handle edge cases (e.g., user has zero work experience).

## Session 6 - Testing, Debugging & Advanced Customization (2 hours)

### Development (1 hour 30 mins)

- **Test** the entire flow thoroughly:
  - Resume/cover letter generation
  - ATS keyword insertion
  - Job matching & HR agent feedback
- **Debug** issues (e.g., repeated text, missing data fields, off-topic AI responses).
- **Add advanced customization** if time permits:
  - Different resume styles (creative, technical, corporate)
  - Additional cover letter variants for multiple job postings
- **Use your AI assistant** to troubleshoot issues and refine prompts or data structures.

### Learning Reflection (30 mins)

- **Document** repeated AI pitfalls (e.g., hallucinations, repeated phrases).
- **Review** how you handle AI “mistakes”:
  - Are you validating or sanitizing AI output?
- **List** new tasks or improvements discovered during testing.
- **Ask** your AI assistant for best practices on versioning and controlling prompt changes over time.

  2. **Tier 2**: ATS optimization
  3. **Tier 3**: Job matching & HR agent
- **List** potential **future enhancements** (e.g., advanced analytics, integration with LinkedIn or real job boards).
- **Use your AI assistant** to clarify any remaining uncertainties (prompt engineering, advanced NLP techniques, etc.).
